Eddy's folder for SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!

### Background
Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. 

### Part 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration
Python and SQLAlchemy is used to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. All of the analysis is completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. This analysis can be found in the climate_analysis notebook.

### Part 2 - Climate App
A Flask API is designed based on the queries from part 1. Code can be found in app.py.

### Bonus
Further temperature and rainfall analysis is provided in the temp_analysis_bonus notebooks.
